<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Otoacoustic Emissions (OAE) Screening Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Transent Evoked Otoacoustic Emissions</li><li>Distortion Product Otoacoustic Emission</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Otoacoustic emissions (OAE) screening systems are categorized into two main types: Transient Evoked Otoacoustic Emissions (TEOAE) and Distortion Product Otoacoustic Emissions (DPOAE). TEOAE measures the ear's response to brief acoustic stimuli, providing insights into cochlear function, particularly for newborn hearing screenings. DPOAE, on the other hand, assesses the ear's response to pairs of tones, offering more detailed frequency-specific information, making it suitable for clinical audiology evaluations. Both types are essential for early detection of hearing impairments.</p></p>
