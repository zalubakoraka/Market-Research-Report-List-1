<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The CMOS Sensors for UAV Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Rolling Shutter</li><li>Global Shutter</li></ul></p>
<p><p>CMOS sensors are crucial for UAV markets, with two main types: rolling shutter and global shutter. Rolling shutter captures images line by line, which can lead to distortions during fast movement, making it ideal for applications where speed is less critical. In contrast, global shutter captures the entire frame simultaneously, minimizing motion blur, making it suitable for high-speed scenarios and dynamic environments. Choosing between these sensors depends on the specific imaging needs of UAV applications, such as aerial mapping or real-time surveillance.</p></p>
