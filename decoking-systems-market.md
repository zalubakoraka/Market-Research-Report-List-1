<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Decoking Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Hydraulic Decoking Systems</li><li>Closed Coke Slurry System (CCSS)</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Decoking systems are essential in petroleum refineries for removing solid coke deposits from reactor units. Hydraulic Decoking Systems utilize high-pressure water jets to dislodge and flush out coke efficiently, promoting continuous operation. In contrast, Closed Coke Slurry Systems (CCSS) manage coke removal by converting it into a slurry, which is then transported for further processing or disposal. Both systems enhance refinery productivity and optimize equipment life by ensuring effective maintenance of reactors in the coking process.</p></p>
